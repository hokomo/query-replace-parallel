* =query-replace-parallel=

A parallel variant of Emacs' built-in =query-replace= and =query-replace-parallel=.

The package is not yet published on an Elisp package archive, so for now, clone
the repository (or download the main =query-replace-parallel.el= Elisp file) and
load it manually.

For example, if you've downloaded the main Elisp file to the directory
=~/query-replace-parallel=, you can use =use-package= like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package query-replace-parallel
    :load-path "~/query-replace-parallel"
    :commands (query-replace-parallel query-replace-parallel-regexp))
#+END_SRC
